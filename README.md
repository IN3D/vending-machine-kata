This repo contains a `.ruby-version` file, so if you are using rvm, it should
automatically switch to ruby version 2.2.3, provided it is installed.

The `Gemfile` contains all the requirements for the project. To install them
simply use bundler like so:
```
bundle install
```

Tests can be run with rspec from the command line:
```
rspec
```

For nicer output, append the color flag:
```
rspec --color
```
